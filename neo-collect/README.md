Neo Collections
==========

The Immutable class supports
- convenience methods to merge ImmutableCollections
- [Java8 collectors](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Collector.html) to creaete Immutable collections

TODO: do we really need this Class?. Is there a direct support by (a future) version of Google Guava?
