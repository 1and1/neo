Neo Collections
==========

The Immutable class supports
- convenience methods to merge ImmutableCollections
- [Java8 collectors](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Collector.html) to create Immutable collections

TODO: do we really need Neo Collections?. Is there a direct support by (a future version of) Google Guava? 
      Answer: For immutable builders, *persistent* collections are needed, not immutable ones. Consider replacing this whole package by e.g. [pcollections](https://github.com/hrldcpr/pcollections).
